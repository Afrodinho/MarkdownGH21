Hello my name is Kaden I created this for my Digital Systems Class

I once made a block of code in python. Lets see how it works in Markdown!

    def myFunction() :
    return True

    if myFunction() :

        print('aboutme.py')

        print('Kaden Marshall')

        print('I am 22 years old and my birthday is October 22nd')

        print('I was born in Columbia, MO')

        print('I am 6 feet 1 inch')

        print('My favorite sports are soccer, basketball, and baseball')

        print('I have a Labradoodle named Callie')

        print('I am using a 15 inch Macbook Pro')

        print('this is a block of code!')
    
    else:

        print('this did not work')

        print('try again')
